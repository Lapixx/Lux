Web app to generate TOTP tokens

HTML5 application for generating TOTP tokens (used in a lot of 2 factor authorisation systems).

Currently only generates a single token (based a 'fake' password) for demonstrating how it works. Should be able to manually enter passwords and store them in later versions, to make it actually usable.
